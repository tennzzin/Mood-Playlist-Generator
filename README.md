# Mood Playlist Generator ðŸŽµðŸ§ 

## Overview

The Mood Playlist Generator is a Python-based web app that analyzes a user's **text or facial expression** to detect their emotional state, then recommends a Spotify playlist based on that mood. Built with **Flask**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, and **DeepFace**, this project blends **NLP** and **facial emotion recognition** to create a personalized music experience.

## Features
- **Text Mood Detection**: Enter how youâ€™re feeling, and the app will analyze your input using an emotion-aware NLP model.
- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Upload a selfie, and the app will detect your dominant facial emotion with DeepFace.
- **Spotify Playlist Integration**: Get a curated playlist that matches your mood using the Spotify API.
- **Modern Web UI**: Clean and responsive interface powered by HTML, CSS, and Flask templating.
- **Secure Key Handling**: Uses `.env` to safely store API credentials.

  - Type how youâ€™re feeling or upload a photo to generate your mood-based playlist!

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers` - for text-based mood detection using Hugging Face
  - `deepface` - for facial emotion recognition
  - `spotipy` - for interacting with the Spotify Web API
  - `python-dotenv` - for secure API key management

 ## Skills Demonstrated
 - **NLP & Emotion Detection**  
   Used a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to detect emotions like joy, sadness, fear, and anger from text.
    
 - **Computer Vision**
   Integrated DeepFace to analyze facial expressions and extract dominant emotions from images. 
   
 - **API Integration**
   Connected with Spotify to fetch public playlists based on emotional context.
   
 - **Web Development**
   Developed a full-stack Flask app with clean UI and dynamic playlist generation.
   
 - **Security Best Practices**
   Managed API keys securely with `.env` and `.gitignore`.
